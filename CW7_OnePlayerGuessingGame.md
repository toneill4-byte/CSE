# Activity 1.1.5: One-Player Guessing Game

## 🎯 Performance Objective
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to evaluate and implement loops by modifying the two-player guessing game into a one-player game using iteration.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives
* Implement simple count-while loops to achieve iteration.
* Implement conditional statements to build a countdown clock.
* Understand that sequencing, selection, and iteration are the core building blocks of algorithms.
* Develop an app that allows a user to play a guessing game against a randomly generated number ("the computer").

---

## 🧠 Prior Knowledge
In the previous activity, you built a two-player guessing game using local and global variables, Boolean expressions, and conditional statements. In this activity, you will modify that code so the computer automatically generates a random secret number instead of requiring a second player to type one in.

---

## ⚠️ Key Concepts & Misconceptions
* **While Loop Logic:** Pay close attention to loop headers and termination conditions. Remember that a while loop continues executing as long as its conditional expression evaluates to `true`.

### Pseudocode Practice
Assume a game where the first team to score 5 points wins. Write the appropriate Boolean expression inside the loop condition below so the game stops once 5 points are scored:

```java
int score = 0;
while (/* Insert Boolean expression here */)
{  
    KeepPlayingGame();  
    score = score + 1;
}
print(score);
endGame();
